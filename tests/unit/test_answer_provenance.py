"""The service half of the model pills: which model ANSWERED, and whether it searched.

The console shows two pills at the top right: the model that answered the last request, and
``Search`` when that answer used an online search tool. Both come from response headers the kit
emits (``install_answer_provenance`` in ``api/app.py``) for whatever the model adapters NOTED as
they called. Before a request is answered the pill shows ``generator_model`` from ``/healthz``,
so that value must be the model the bound adapter calls, never one a configuration flag names
while the adapter calls another.

The narration brief carries no sampling parameter: the ``local`` narrator is the
deterministic draft, and the ``gcp`` narrator refuses rather than answering, so it notes nothing.
